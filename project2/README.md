# Project 2

I made a chat platform called Flack. With this platform, users can choose their display name and then create their own channel or join an existing channel.

Each user who joins will have a unique random color that is visible on their display name.
When the user closes Flack and reopens it without logging out, Flack still remember the display name and the unique color and user will redirected into the last channel the user was on.

Chats in the channel are displayed in real-time and can hold up to 100 chats.
