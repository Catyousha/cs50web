# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

On this project, I'm making a book platform that users can have an account to search and view book details then submit ratings and reviews.
There are file called import.py that importing books data from CSV into the database, and application.py that is the core of this website. There also templates folder that contains HTML files that is front-end of the website.
